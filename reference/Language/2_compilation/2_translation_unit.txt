Translation unit:
----------------

  In C and C++, a translation unit is the basic unit of source code that the compiler processes 
after preprocessing and before code generation.

Precise definition:

  A translation unit consists of:

            - One source file (e.g., .c, .cpp)
            - Plus all the contents of headers and macros included into it via #include and 
            other preprocessor directives

  After the preprocessor runs, the compiler sees one large, combined source file — that is the translation unit.

  Think of a translation unit as: “What the compiler sees when compiling one source file.”

Example:

    // main.cpp
            #include <iostream>
            #include "utils.h"

            int main() {
                print();
            }

    // utils.h
            void print();


    After preprocessing, the translation unit is effectively:

    // main.cpp (after preprocessing)
            void print();

            int main() {
                print();
            }

    This entire result is one translation unit.


Key points:
        - Each .c or .cpp file becomes a separate translation unit
        - Headers (.h) do not form translation units on their own
        - The same header included in multiple .cpp files becomes part of multiple translation units
        - Translation units are compiled independently
        - The linker later combines the compiled translation units into a final program

-- Why translation units matter?

   They affect:

        1. Linkage

            -- static functions/variables have internal linkage (visible only within one translation unit)
            -- Non-static globals have external linkage (visible across translation units)

        2. One Definition Rule (ODR)

            -- Some entities must be defined once per program
            -- Others may be defined once per translation unit

           Violating ODR often leads to linker errors or undefined behavior.

        3. Compile times and dependencies

            Changes to headers can force recompilation of every translation unit that includes them
