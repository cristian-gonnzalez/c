Shared Objects (Dynamic Libraries):
----------------------------------
  Shared libraries allow code to be loaded at runtime instead of being bundled into the executable.


- Platform-specific extensions:

    .so     - linux (shared object)
    .dll    - windows (dynamic linked library)
    .dylib  - macOS  (dynamic library)


- Relevant gcc options:

  -f flag
        PIC    Position Independent Code:
                 The job of the linker is relocation and resolution of symbols. -fPIC is needed to make shared libraries work.
                 
                 Shared libraries must be position independent so they can be loaded at arbitrary memory addresses. The linker 
               performs relocation and symbol resolution, and -fPIC enables this behavior.
  -shared      Produce a shared library instead of an executable.
  -o           Specify the output file name.


-- Project structure:

            $ tree
            .
            ├── include
            │   ├── cmath.h
            │   └── cmult.h
            └── src
                ├── cmath.c
                ├── cmult.c
                └── main.c

            2 directories, 5 files

-- Create the shared libraries:

            $ gcc -fPIC -shared ./src/cmath.c -I./include -o cmath.so
            $ ls
            cmath.so  include  src
            ^~~~~~~~

            $ gcc -fPIC -shared ./src/cmult.c -I./include -o cmult.so
            $ ls
            cmath.so  cmult.so  include  src
            ^~~~~~~~  ^~~~~~~~

NOTE:
    - Shared libraries are loaded at runtime by the dynamic linker
    - Multiple programs can share the same shared library in memory
    - Executables linked against shared libraries are usually smaller
    - Updating a shared library does not require recompiling programs
    that use it (as long as the ABI is compatible)
