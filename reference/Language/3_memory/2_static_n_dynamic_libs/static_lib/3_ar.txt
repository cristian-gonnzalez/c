ar — Static Library Archiver:
----------------------------

  The 'ar' (archive) tool builds an index of multiple files that we can package together.
  This allows us to distrbute a static library that may consist of multiples .o files packaged togehther.

    r  - Insert files into the archive (replace if they already exist)
    c  - Create the archive if it does not already exist
    s  - Add an index to the archive (similar to running ranlib)


-- Create a static library:

            $ ar rcs mymath.a cmath.o cmult.o 
                    ^~~~~~~~ ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    ^            ^
                    |     object files to archive
                    |
                output archive (static library)


            $ ls
            cmath.o  cmult.o  include  main.o  mymath.a  prog  src
                                            ^~~~~~~~
    NOTE:
        '.a' is named by convention for archive 
        A '.a' file is an archive of one or more object files

-- Build the program using the static library:
   Link the static library with main.o to build the executable:

            $ gcc main.o mymath.a -o prog 
            $ ./prog 
            add(4, 7) = 11
            mult(4, 7) = 28

Static linking notes:
    When we 'statically link', everything is bundled together. This simplifies distribution to anyone to run './prog'.
However, we are packages everything together, so think carefully if this what you want since static linking increases 
the executable size and makes updates harder
