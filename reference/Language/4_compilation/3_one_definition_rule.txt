The One Definition Rule (ODR):
-----------------------------

  The One Definition Rule says:

        Certain entities in a C/C++ program must have exactly one 'definition', while others 
      may have multiple definitions, depending on their kind and linkage.

  Violating the ODR results in 'undefined behavior' (sometimes a linker error, sometimes silent bugs).


NOTE: Declaration vs Definition (important distinction):

    Before ODR makes sense:

        int x;        // declaration AND definition
        extern int y; // declaration only


    - Declaration: tells the compiler something exists
    - Definition: actually creates the entity (storage or body)

-- Linkage: Internal vs External
    Linkage determines visibility across translation units.

--- Internal Linkage:

    An entity with internal linkage:

        - Is visible only within its translation unit
        - Each translation unit gets its own separate instance

    Created by:

        - static at namespace/global scope
        - unnamed namespaces (C++)
        - some const globals in C++

    Example

            // file1.cpp
            static int counter = 0;  // internal linkage

            // file2.cpp
            static int counter = 0;  // completely different variable

    These do not conflict.

-- External Linkage:

    An entity with external linkage:

        - Is visible across translation units
        - Refers to one shared entity in the program

    Created by:

        - Non-static globals
        - Functions by default
        - extern variables

    Example:

            // file1.cpp
            int counter = 0;  // external linkage

            // file2.cpp
            int counter = 0;  // ❌ ODR violation (multiple definitions)
