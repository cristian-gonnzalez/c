NOTE: 
    Linker errors usually are 'undefined reference' type mesages.
    They are comming from the linker, stating that some code is otherwise missing -- specially the implementation (expected in a .c, .o or ,so file)

Link the libraries

WARNING:
    Pay careful attention to what '-l' (lowecase L) is doing here.
    It expects the library named 'libcmath.so' (prefix:lib and suffix:.so)
                                ~~~      ~~
    When we pass in our library 'lib' and '.so' are not needed.

Now we need to specify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You can put your libraries in a know location if you need. Often times, 'program launchers' (executable, scripts) 
will prepend this path for you

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./" ./prog
    add(4, 7) = 11
    mult(4, 7) = 28


$ objdump -t prog

                This tools is telling me that the function exitst but they dont know
                what to do with this. That's why we need to specify where to look for
