ar:

The 'ar' (archive) tool builds an index of multiple files that we can package together.
This allows us to distrbute a static library that may consist of multiples .o files packaged togehther.

r - Does insertion (by replacement) into the archive
c - Creates the archive
s - Adds an index into the archive (see ranlib as well)


    $ ar rcs mymath.a cmath.o cmult.o 
            ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            ^            ^
            output   files we want to index

    $ ls
    cmath.o  cmult.o  include  main.o  mymath.a  prog  src
                                    ~~~~~~~~

    NOTE: '.a' is named by convention for archive 


2: Build our prog

    $ gcc main.o mymath.a -o prog 
    $ ./prog 
    add(4, 7) = 11
    mult(4, 7) = 28

When we 'statically link', everything is bundled together. This simplifies distribution to anyone to run './prog'.
However, we are packages everything together, so think carefully if this what you want.
